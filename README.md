# EveryRay-Rendering-Engine

![picture](screenshots/EveryRay_testScene_simple.png)

# Overview
"EveryRay" is a rendering engine which is written in C++ and which focuses on quick prototyping of graphical techniques and features. It is lightweight, easy to use and already contains many existing rendering solutions inside. The project is constantly improving when I have some free time for it:) 

Publicly supported APIs:
- DirectX 11
- DirectX 12 (WIP, not released yet)

Video demonstrations (scroll down for screenshots):
- https://youtu.be/_htQNxesr9U (to be updated)

***
**Note (will be removed with v1.0)**: after years of development and increased popularity on Github in recent months, I decided to start preparing the release of the first proper version of this project (v1.0). I would like to: add a wiki page, license, refactored structure and, most importantly, clean all the previous functionalities and make them ready to be used by the public.

# Some of the rendering features
- Deferred + Forward Rendering
- Local illumination w/ Physically Based Rendering
- Global illumination w/:
- - Static: Image Based Lighting from light probes:
- - - diffuse (2nd order spherical harmonics)
- - - specular (cubemaps)
- - Dynamic: Cascaded Voxel Cone Tracing (AO, diffuse, specular)
- Cascaded Shadow Mapping
- Parallax-Occlusion Mapping w/ soft self-shadowing
- Separable Subsurface Scattering
- Terrain w/ GPU tessellation
- Foliage
- Volumetric clouds
- Volumetric fog
- Post Processing: Linear Fog, SSR, Tonemap, LUT color grading, Vignette, FXAA

# Some of the engine concepts/features
- Concept of an RHI (aka "Rendering Hardware Interface"): graphics API is abstracted from the general code (systems, etc.)
- Concept of a simplified generic game object - "ER_RenderingObject":
- - supports model loading (.obj, .fbx and etc.) with Assimp Library
- - supports multiple meshes
- - supports texture loading (.png, .jpg, .dds)
- - supports materials
- - supports GPU instancing
- - supports LOD groups
- - supports AABB (with visualization)
- - supports on-terrain procedural placement & instances distribution
- - customizable via "Object editor" (with instancing support)
- Concept of a generic scene, which contains "ER_RenderingObject" elements + scene data (lights, terrain, GI and other info):
- - supports loading from & saving to JSON scene files
- CPU frustum culling
- ImGUI, ImGuizmo
 
# Roadmap (big architectural engine tasks)
 * [X] <del>remove DX11 "Effects" library, all .fx shaders and refactor the material system (DONE)</del> (https://github.com/steaklive/EveryRay-Rendering-Engine/pull/51)
 * [X] <del>remove all low-level DX11 code and put it into the abstracted RHI (DONE)</del> (https://github.com/steaklive/EveryRay-Rendering-Engine/pull/56)
 * [ ] add support for DX12
 * [ ] remove DirectXMath and its usages (maybe come up with a custom math lib)
 * [ ] add cross-API shader compiler
 * [ ] add simple job-system (i.e. for Update(), CPU culling, etc.)
 * [ ] add simple memory management system (for now CPU memory; at least linear, pool allocators)

# Roadmap (big graphics tasks)
 * [ ] Order Independent Transparency (in Forward pass)
 * [ ] Atmospheric Scattering (Mie, etc.)
 * [ ] Better Anti-Aliasing (SMAA, TAA, explore FSR/DLSS)

# Controls
- Mouse + Right Click - camera rotation
- WASD - camera side movement
- E/Q - camera up/down movement
- Backspace - enable editor
- R/T/Y - scale/translate/rotate object in the editor mode

# Notes
You might increase TDR time of your GPU driver (explained here https://docs.substance3d.com/spdoc/gpu-drivers-crash-with-long-computations-128745489.html).
